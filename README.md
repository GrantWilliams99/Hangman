# Overview

I made a simple version of the game Hangman. The player has a choice of five categories, one of which can be added onto by the user themselves. The program will then choose a random word from the category, and it's up to the player to guess what the word is. If the player guesses six incorrect letters, they lose. 

I wrote this program to understand how to write in Java better. I learned a few of the basics of the language in high school, but it's been years since I've really gotten into it and programmed with it.

Here's a link to a demo of my program: [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Future Work

There are a few things I'd like to one day improve upon this program in the future.

* A more robust selection are to make choosing the Custom List inaccessible if the Custom List is empty
* Allow the Custom List to accept words with spaces as one entry (such as "washing machine" or "radio station")
* Prevent duplicate incorrect guesses from adding to the hangman
